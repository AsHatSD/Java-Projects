Anonymous is an activist group. In 2003, it first appeared and it is known for its successful attacks on organisations.
After the Paris attacks, French hackers from the group declared war on the Islamic State.
The group uploaded a video to YouTube. A member of Anonymous says in the video that there will be very many cyber-attacks.
This is not the first Anonymous attack on the Islamic State – after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January, a Belgian part of the group declared war against al-Qaeda, the Islamic State and other terrorists. It later said that it deleted 1,500 pro-Islamic State Twitter and Facebook accounts.
