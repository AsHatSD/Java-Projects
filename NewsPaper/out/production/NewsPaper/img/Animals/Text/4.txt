As Munro the penguin bulks up for moulting season, staff at Taronga Zoo check his weight.
When penguins shed their feathers, they can't fish for food, so it's important they prepare for the annual moulting season by building up fat reserves. Munro weighs in at 3.3 kilograms before gulping down his reward.
He won't look so trim when he starts the moulting process, consuming 1.2 kilograms of fish each day until he reaches 5.5 kilograms. Penguins aren’t waterproof when they moult, so they stay on land for 2-3 weeks until new feathers emerge from below the skin.
This week's weigh-in also meant Munro could take a stroll through the zoo.
