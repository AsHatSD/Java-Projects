A giant panda is seen here giving birth to one of her twin cubs in Toronto Zoo – the first baby pandas born in Canada since 2013. The panda, called Er Shun, delivered the cubs 13 minutes apart and they will now be cared for in a maternity area of the giant panda house for several months.
Er Shun and her zoo partner Da Mao are on loan from China for 10 years as part of a long-term breeding program.
