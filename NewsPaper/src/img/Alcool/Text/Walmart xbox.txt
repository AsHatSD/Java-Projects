Walmart today announced its Cyber Monday offers. 
They aren't nearly as extensive as what will be available on Black Friday, but there are still some decent deals to be had.
One of the retailer's video game deals is the Gears of War Ultimate Edition Xbox One bundle with an extra controller for $300.
Note, however, that the bonus controller is a third-party pad.
